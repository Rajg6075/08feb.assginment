    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "ANS= In Python, the abc module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a mechanism to define abstract classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own but serve as blueprints for other classes. Abstract base classes are meant to be subclassed, and they define a set of methods (abstract methods) that must be implemented by their subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to implement interfaces and enforce certain behaviors in derived classes, promoting a more structured and consistent approach to object-oriented programming. The main purpose of using abstract base classes is to ensure that specific methods are present in the derived classes, providing a common interface or contract for those classes to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefits of using the abc module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcement of Interface: Abstract base classes help enforce a specific set of methods that must be implemented in the derived classes. \n",
    "This makes it easier to understand the expected behavior of subclasses.\n",
    "Code Documentation: Abstract base classes provide a clear documentation of what methods should be implemented by subclasses, improving code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "Polymorphism: Abstract base classes facilitate polymorphism, as different classes can share a common interface through subclassing the abstract base class."

    "Data abstraction can be achieved in programming languages, including Python, through the use of abstract classes and abstract methods. \n",
